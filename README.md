# My Awesome Project
Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and a portfolio site with links to my work and contact information.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice
The main things I learned were how to change an image element's source and how to create a standard size for non-standard images. performed quite well on desktops, however some media queries are still needed for the mobile version.

## Optimizations
Instead of developing a method that modifies the size and placement after rendering, I would have created a container for the objects that could have automatically adjusted each image. It completed the task, but adding new features and updating it was extremely difficult. Before releasing the second iteration of the game—which will have a hard mode with every kind of Pokemon—I would really consider streamlining the code.

## Lessons Learned:
I discovered that I should absolutely be on the lookout for methods, approaches, or frameworks that may help me write bespoke functions and corrections for every single piece in order to make my work more scalable and efficient.
